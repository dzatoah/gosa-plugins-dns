Target for 2.6:
===============

* Move from gosa.conf-trunk to gosa.conf when we're ready

* ACL
  - Acl roles should be selectable in acl dialog
  - Role checks are missing
  - Copy & Paste tmplates for acl roles
  - Check Title strings 
  - Check role and acl remove
  - Check Base select dialog within roles
  - Implement a kind of "umask"
  - Ensure that acls will be the same after renaming and moving objects
  
* Redo the setup

* Create a bug submitter

* Make plugin loader react on predefined info values from plugins itself instead of
  gosa.conf

* Can't use a dn longer than 100 characters as Glpi contact/technical responsible person.

* Verify DNS plugin
  * Zones are not creatable, currently
  * Error messages are partly wrong

* Auto-Resize for subdialogs

* Asterisk : Create entry like this #309,1,PickupChan(SIP/rainer),

Target for 3.0:
===============

* Complete PHP5 compliance and optimization

* Simplify plugins by providing a schema parser

* Replace PHP IMAP module by self made module

* Make IMAP namespace configurable

* Add possibility to add referrals in department dialog

* Fine tuning in Kerberos support
  Special kerberos attributes like ticket expiery and policies can't
  be handeled with GOsa right now this has to be added in later releases.
  
* SSL
  User certificates are only shown as "absent" or "present", because the
  SSL PHP module isn't buildable in the moment. I'll check this later on.
    (Notes:
     openssl x509 -outform DER -in incert.pem  -out outcert.der
     ldif -b "usercertificate;binary" < outcert.der   > cert.ldif
     print_r(openssl_x509_parse ($this->userCertificate));
    )
    
* Documentation
  - End user documentation: online help
  - Administrators documentation: how to install / contributed scripts, etc.
  - Developer documentation: how to extend, own plugins, themes, etc.

* Automatic passwords?
  Generate a password for a newly created user and display it.
